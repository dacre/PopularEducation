# PopularEducation

This project aims to collect Swedish (first out Stockholm) public seminars in a easy to access and easy to search manner so that people easier can educate themselves in interesting topics.

Currently Stockholm University and Folkuniversitet are supported from a scraping point of view. The results are put in a HTML table. 

Some of the planned work:
- make the frontend
- add more sources (KTH and ABF for example)
- deploy to a real domain (no good domain name found)
